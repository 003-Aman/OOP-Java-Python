/* 
 * packages and access modifiers
 * different types of packages like for color, data modification , different packages have different uses
 * built in packages which we import and which we make for our own use
 * 
 * Access modifiers: fincance data should not be revealed to management or tech team , this is why we need access modifiers
 *public - the function/datatype  can be accessed by everyone
 default - it is default if we dont specify anything, our package can access it but a different package cannot
 protected - can be accessed by own package but if someone wants to use it in another package, can only access subclasses nothing else
private - can be accessed only inside a class not outside the class, not even subclass, and also not in other packages

if we have to access private functions and datatypes we have to use setters and getters
